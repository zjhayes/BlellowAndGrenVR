# Blellow & Gren
## Forbidden Colors VR Science Experiment

This Unity VR project gives its players the opportunity to see "Forbidden Colors".

Colors of light on opposing channels can't be combined by your eyes, those are called forbidden colors. If the eyes take in these colors separately, the brain can combine them. That's what this VR science experiment does, it shows you objects and each of your eyes will perceive it in a different color. If you're lucky, your brain will combine them into forbidden colors, giving you an experience of colors you've never seen.

Requires Unity 2021.3.4f1 and Oculus Quest 2, not tested on other VR systems.

WARNING - Flashing colors, may cause seizures or may be annoying. This is for science!

## Forbidden Colors

### Blellow and Gren?

"Blellow" is the color that results from the simultaneous perception of blue and yellow light (not the same as the green you get when you mix paints). It's often experienced as a pale bluish-green or cyan color.

"Gren" is the color that results from the simultaneous perception of green and red light. It's often experienced as a pale yellow color.

The terms "Blellow" and "Gren" are not official names, and are just fun ways to label what you could potentially experience.

### What Are Forbidden Colors?

Forbidden colors are perceived colors that are difficult or even impossible to experience through the normal process of mixing light or pigments. They result from the way our visual system processes color information, and they challenge our understanding of color theory.

### Why Are They "Forbidden"?

The term "forbidden colors" arises from the concept that our eyes and brain are sensitive to specific color combinations, leading to certain combinations of colors being rarely seen. These combinations typically involve pairs of colors that lie on opposite sides of the color wheel.

## VR Experience Details

### Gameplay

In this VR experience, you'll see an object displayed in different colors to each of your eyes. These colors are specifically designed to trigger the perception of forbidden colors. By observing and interacting with these colors, you'll gain a unique understanding of the concept and witness its effects in action.

### Controls

Use the VR headset controls to navigate through the VR environment and interact with the objects.

## The Science Behind It

### Color Perception

Our eyes have three types of color receptors (cones) that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. The brain processes the signals from these cones to create our perception of color. When each eye is separately presented with specific color combinations, the brain processes them in a way that can create the illusion of forbidden colors.

### Opponent Process Theory

The opponent process theory explains how our visual system processes color information. It suggests that we perceive colors in three opponent pairs: red-green, blue-yellow, and black-white. When our eyes are exposed to one color, the opponent color is temporarily suppressed, keeping us blind to forbidden colors.

## Getting Started

To experience the Forbidden Colors VR Experience, follow these steps:

1. Install Unity and the necessary VR hardware and software.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the Unity project and navigate to the VR scene.
4. Deploy the VR experience to your VR hardware.
5. Look at the colors. If they flash, and don't mold into a forbidden color, you may not be able to see them. Sorry. It's just for fun.
